Python 3.10 required

This project allows you to play Poker in your device or even run a telegram bot!

Different ways of using our project:
1) Run Poker/main.py to play poker in Terminal (or add your own Visual scheme and use our inner logic)
2) Run PokerBot/main.py and play Poker via Telegram Bot (API token you sould put into file put_token_here or use our bot @TruePokerBot)

P.S. There is a Dockerfile with which you can run Telegram Bot in Docker Image
